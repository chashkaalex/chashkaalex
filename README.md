- 👋 Hi, my name is Alex Chashka.
- 👀 I’m interested in development in general and web-dev in particular.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a junior software engineer (main stack is c++/c#/CQL) and I'm on the mission to expand my knowledge and learn new tools and languages. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any opensource project where someone like me could be of use. 
- 📫 E-mail me at chashkaalex@gmail.com
