- 👋 Hi, my name is Alex Chashka.
- 👀 I’m interested in development in general and web-dev in particular.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all kinds of languages (ranging from C to ES) and general development concenpt (i.e. design patterns)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any opensource project where someone like me could be of use. In time I hope to find an entry level development job.
